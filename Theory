Recursion: -
    When a function calls itself until a certain condition is satisfied is called as recursion.
If there is not a stopping condition then it is called infinite recursion.
e.g of infinte recursion (Stack overflow): -
      void print()
      {
        cout<<1<<endl;
        print();
      }
      int main()
      {
        print();
        return 0;
       }
       
e.g of correct recursion: -
  cnt = 0;
  f()
  {
    if(cnt == 4)
    {
      return;
    }
    print(cnt);
    cnt++;
    f();
  }
  
  int main()
  {
    f();
  }
